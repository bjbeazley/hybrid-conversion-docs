# Requirements Analysis

## Motivation

### Road Trips
I love driving and I love road trips especially in old vehicles. But my truck (1948 F250 with 6.9L diesel engine) has a terrible fuel economy and only seats 3. I get ~15 mpg going 70-75 mph and the highest I’ve ever got to a tank is around 19. This means road trips get expensive for gas and I feel bad for my environmental impact. Going slower would get significantly better mileage as would swapping in an overdrive transmission.

### Hybrid Conversion
I’ve also wanted to do a hybrid vehicle conversion for a long time just because I think it’s really cool to integrate modern technology into an older platform and I really enjoy thinking of the energy balance between ICE, motor, and battery.

### Industrial Generators
I have also been fascinated by industrial / agricultural diesel engines for a long time. These engines are often designed to be serviceable with removable cylinder sleeves rather than requiring boring out the block casting when rebuilding which I find satisfying. These engines often do not produce much power relative to their weight compared to automotive engines because they are designed for continuous output at rated power rather than brief periods of high output. Using one of these engines in a hybrid would allow the electric motor to provide bursts of power for acceleration.

Using an industrial diesel engine is admittedly not as practical as using a light and cheap engine as a range extender but this project is already being done mostly for style and as a personal challenge. If the goal was simply for cheap fuel efficient transportation the easiest solution would be to purchase a used prius.

## Stakeholders

### Myself
The primary stakeholder in this project is myself. I want to do a hybrid conversion for the reasons previously listed and I will be funding the project. Once complete, I will be the primary driver of the vehicle.

### Friends
Once the conversion is complete I would like to be able to use the hybrid for road trips with FR-iends. This means that the vehicle must be reliable, comfortable, and quiet to avoid disrupting plans.

### Roommates
This project will require space to work on it, and space to store the vehicle when complete which impacts my roommates

## Scope
The scope of this project is converting an antique vehicle into a hybrid. The basis of the conversion is to be an existing vehicle body which makes it easy to ensure the vehicle is street legal since the manufacturer has already ensured compliance. Most of the work required will be updating the powertrain.
